        <p><i>Kawaii Tomodachi-desu</i> is an auto-generated dating sim featuring your Facebook friends. Built in 24 hours for Valentine's Day at TartanHacks, it aims to bring joy to friends who wish to date each other in a judgment-free virtual world.</p>

        <p>Based off of popular Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_sim" target="_blank">dating simulations</a>, <i>Kawaii Tomodachi-desu</i> creates a romantic adventure starring your very own Facebook friends. Each dating sim is tailored toward your friend: custom dialogue is generated by analyzing your friends' Facebook posts. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press" target="_blank">dissociated press</a> algorithm, it chains together words in a believable yet nonsensical babble. Don't worry-- we don't store any personal information anywhere. All dialogue is generated on the fly!</p>

        <p>Brought to you by Esther, Ivan, Jun, and Roger at TartanHacks 2016. Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
